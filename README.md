# Prework Study Guide Project

## Description

I created this project in order to access notes regarding some of the fundamentals for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.  It's created in an easy to digest format that contains multiple easy to perform tips.  There are also some general reminders that will be easy to review if a client becomes stuck in the future.  With this project I learned that debugging can be easier to perform when there are less mistakes within the code due to not knowing the basics.  It inspired me to keep trying to perfect the syntax of things and improve my abilities inputing them.
